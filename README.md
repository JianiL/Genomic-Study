# Genomic-Study

This script is used for identifying the genetics risk factors for complex diseases leveraging the pedigrees.

The input file is a variant vcf file (next-generation sequencing) annotated by Cassandra or Annovar.  You will also need to provide the ethnicity of the input samples. The output is a list of variants that potently associated with the disease and their p-values.
